\section{Conclusion}
We present a novel {\em distribution aware} password throttling mechanism $\DALock$ that penalizes incorrect passwords proportionally to their popularity. We show that $\DALock$ can be reliably instantiated with either a password strength model such as $\ZXCVBN$ or with a differentially private count sketch. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that $\DALock$ offers a superior balance between security and usability and is particularly effective when used in combination with a short banlist of overly popular passwords. For example, we are able to  reduce the success rate of an attacker to $0.05\%$ (compared to $1\%$ for the $10$-strikes mechanism) whilst simultaneously reducing the unwanted lockout rate to just $0.08\%$ (compared to $4\%$ for the $3$-strikes mechanism).
